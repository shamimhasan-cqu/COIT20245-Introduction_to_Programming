# Images Directory


Upload all your screenshots and images to this directory. 

Give meaningful names to your files before you upload them. Avoid spaces and obscure special characters in the filename. Use just letters, numbers, dash (-) or underscore (_). For example:

- risk-tvamatrix.png
- main_network_diagram.jpg

Then in your project report link to those images. For example, use the code:

```
The network diagram for the small LAN:
![Main Network Diagram](./images/main_network_diagram.jpg)
```
